            "Consistency Test: (\"Yes, in moderation, coffee can be part of a healthy diet. Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation and boost overall health. Studies have found that coffee can potentially lower the risk of diseases like type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and liver disease. Coffee can also help improve cognitive function and mood.\\n\\nHowever, coffee can also have negative effects if consumed excessively, such as disrupting sleep patterns, causing digestion issues, increasing blood pressure, or causing dependency due to its caffeine content. It's also important to consider what is added to coffee—such as sugar, syrups, or cream—that can increase the caloric content.\\n  \\nDrinking coffee in moderation (approximately 3-4 cups per day) appears to be safe for most people, but it can vary based on individual health situation and tolerance to caffeine. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider about specific dietary and health concerns.\", \"Coffee is not inherently unhealthy, but it depends on how much you consume and what you add to it. In moderation, coffee contains antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease. Some studies suggest that coffee drinkers are less likely to suffer from certain serious diseases.\\n\\nHowever, consuming large amounts of coffee (more than 400 mg of caffeine per day according to Mayo Clinic) can potentially lead to health issues, including insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, digestive problems, and an increased heart rate. Additionally, adding a lot of sugar, cream, or flavored syrups can turn your coffee into a high-calorie beverage, which may contribute to weight gain and other health problems. \\n\\nIt's also worth noting that people have different levels of caffeine tolerance. For some, even a small amount could cause unpleasant side effects. Pregnant women, people taking certain medications, and those with certain health conditions may need to avoid or limit their coffee consumption.\")\n"
