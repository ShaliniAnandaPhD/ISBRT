        "Its primary function is to generate and analyze responses to adversarial prompts using a language model. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
        "   - `streamlit`: Used for creating web applications. It's the backbone of this script, providing the UI and server.\n",
        "   - `openai`: The library to interact with OpenAI's GPT models.\n",
        "   - `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
        "   - `altair`: A declarative statistical visualization library for Python.\n",
        "   - `langchain.llms.OpenAI`: Likely a custom wrapper around the OpenAI API.\n",
        "   - `textblob`: A library for processing textual data, used here for sentiment analysis.\n",
        "   - `nltk`: The Natural Language Toolkit, used for text processing and analysis.\n",
        "   - `textstat`: A library for calculating statistics from text to determine readability, complexity, and grade level.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Setup and Configuration**:\n",
        "   - Downloading necessary NLTK resources.\n",
        "   - Setting up Streamlit page configuration.\n",
        "   - Configuration of the OpenAI API with an API key.\n",
        "   - Handling possible exceptions during API setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Defining Personas**:\n",
        "   - A selection of different 'personas' (like Legal Expert, Ethical Philosopher, etc.) is defined. These personas likely represent different styles or focuses in responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Streamlit User Interface**:\n",
        "   - Creating a dropdown for selecting a persona.\n",
        "   - Input fields for users to enter a topic and additional context for the dilemma.\n",
        "   - A function to construct a custom prompt based on the selected persona and user inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Generating and Analyzing Language Model Responses**:\n",
        "   - A function to get responses from the language model based on the custom prompt.\n",
        "   - Analyzing the response includes:\n",
        "     - Sentiment Analysis: Using `TextBlob` to find sentiment polarity of each sentence.\n",
        "     - Keyword Analysis: Using `nltk` to find the frequency of each word (excluding common words like \"also\" and stopwords).\n",
        "     - Readability Analysis: Using `textstat` to calculate various readability scores such as Flesch Reading Ease, SMOG Index, and Coleman-Liau Index.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Visualizations and Output**:\n",
        "   - Visualizing sentiment analysis and keyword frequency using Altair charts.\n",
        "   - A bar chart to represent the readability scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Streamlit App Execution**:\n",
        "   - The app provides an interactive web interface where the user can input their data, generate responses, and see the analysis and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Key Functionalities**:\n",
        "   - The script allows users to simulate how different personas might respond to a given prompt, providing insights into various aspects of the generated text, including sentiment, keyword prominence, and readability.\n",
