# Interactive Scenario-Based Red Teaming (ISBRT) for LLMs 

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the creation of Large Language Models (LLMs) - AI systems capable of sophisticated and increasingly human-like conversations. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's LaMDA demonstrate impressive linguistic abilities but also potential risks around bias, toxicity, and unsafe behavior. 

Interactive Scenario-Based Red Teaming (ISBRT) is a framework designed specifically to evaluate these emergent risks in LLMs and refine the models toward safer, more ethical behavior. 

ISBRT works by simulating scenarios that immerse LLMs in nuanced, morally ambiguous situations - similar to those encountered in the real world. By engaging LLMs in branching dialogue around complex issues like medical ethics, social biases, and escalating tensions, ISBRT provides a controlled environment to audit model responses.

Multiple conversational personas are encoded to evaluate an LLM's reactions across diverse interaction styles. The personas exhibit varied personalities, emotional tones, and access needs to maximize testing coverage. 

During a scenario simulation, an orchestration engine relays messages between personas and the LLM, allowing free-flowing dialogue around pivotal decisions. LLM-generated continuations of the chat are analyzed along several axes - coherence to context, regard for social/cultural sensitivities, de-escalation of conflict, non-toxicity, and safety considerations.

Any concerning model behaviors are flagged during testing. These results are fed back into specialized training modules focused on enhancing ethics and safety - iteratively molding LLMs via reinforcement learning combined with human oversight.  

By leveraging simulated interactions grounded in the real world, ISBRT enables scalable, cost-effective audits of the most cutting-edge conversational AI systems. It serves as a robust framework for steering the development of socially responsible, safe LLMs of the future.


## System Architecture 

The ISBRT framework follows a modular architecture, enabling different components to handle specific functions in the workflow.

### Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer acts as the conductor of the entire pipeline. It initializes and coordinates the other components to execute scenario testing.

Key responsibilities:

- Loading testing parameters like selected scenarios, personas, LLMs
- Initializing components like the Scenario Engine, Personas, LLM Integrator
- Triggering the start of a new simulation run 
- Collating logs, analysis results, and feeding them to the Feedback System
- Handling failure exceptions and restarts

The orchestration module has been built using Python and the Flask web framework. Flask allows the coordinating of all parts in a simple, lightweight architecture.

### Scenario Engine

The Scenario Engine generates the narrative situations used to immerse LLMs. It has the following functionality:

- Storage of a scenario catalog with parameters and dialog trees 
- Adding new testing scenarios covering topics requiring ethical evaluations
- Branching logical flow responding to an LLM's dialog choices
- Injecting supporting context and dynamic content into scenarios  

Implementation: MongoDB for structured scenario storage, Python for execution logic.

### Personas 

These simulate users by adopting distinct conversational profiles when engaging with an LLM. Distinct personas are modeled, and encoded as Python classes.

Personas exhibit varied:  

- Goals: Information-seeking, making requests, arguing
- Personal backgrounds  
- Access needs: Language levels, patience, cultural awareness 
- Reactions: Agreement, confusion, escalation/triggering 

Each persona handles the dialog flow from its perspective according to its encoded profile.

Personas are critical to evaluating an LLM's adaptability and safety across diverse interaction modes. 

### LLM Integrator

Seamlessly interfaces with external LLM models like GPT-3 via API calls. Key capabilities:

- Encoding context preamble for each LLM prompt
- Appending logged dialog for continuity  
- Sending prompt to LLM and returning response 
- Caching prior requests to conserve API quotas
- Handling metadata like LLM model version

Built using Langchain for streamlined LLM integrations. Abstracts underlying complexity behind a simple interface.

### Analysis Suite

Performs computational evaluations of LLM-generated dialog responses from ethics and safety perspectives. 

Quantifies metrics like:

- Contextual coherence
- Regard for social/cultural sensitivities 
- Conflict escalation vs. de-escalation
- Toxicity, bias indicators
- Consideration of safety risks

Implemented via Python, using NLP libraries like SpaCy and TensorFlow.

Analysis results identify priority areas for LLM training improvements.  

### Feedback System

Collates analysis metrics, trends, and outlier responses to derive insights. Prioritizes addressing frequent and high-risk observed issues. 

Drives targeted LLM fine-tuning via:
  
- Reinforcement learning when consistent gaps observed 
- Supervised tuning on specific hazardous response examples
- Updating scenario design to induce and catch issues

Enables continuous evolution of LLMs to elevate ethical responsiveness.

## Conclusion  

This modular, well-integrated architecture allows efficient execution of sophisticated LLM testing via realistic simulations. Each component focuses on a specific facet, enabling extensive evaluations.


## Workflow 

The workflow orchestrates an end-to-end simulation run, facilitating interactions between all components.

### 1. Scenario Initiation

Each simulation run starts by loading a scenario that frames an interaction context between the LLM and personas.

**Orchestrator**

- Queries available scenarios from the Scenario Engine's database
- Select scenario based on testing goals (e.g. evaluate conflict resolution)  
- Initializes the scenario with parameterized details like names, locations, etc.

**Scenario Engine**

- Receives initialization request
- Loads selected scenario from database
- Populates template with provided details 
- Sends preamble content to Orchestrator

For example, an "airline service complaint" scenario may be selected and initialized with customer persona details.

### 2. Persona Activation

Relevant user personas are activated, assigned goals, and inserted into the scenario context.

**Orchestrator** 

- Select personas from the database fitting the scenario  
- Configures personas based on scenario metadata
- Instruct personas to join the scenario dialog

**Personas**

- Receive activation trigger
- Load respective profile data models 
- Initialize internal dialog state  
- Join scenario, receive preamble content
- Prepare goal directives for driving conversation  

E.g. an "irate customer" and "customer service rep" persona.

### 3. Interaction  

Free-flowing LLM-persona interactions around pivotal decisions drive the simulation state.

**Orchestrator**

- Begins interaction loop 
	- Current persona exchanges dialog with LLM  
	- LLM response analyzed after each turn
	- Next persona takes a turn
- Manages escalations and endings
	
**Personas** 

- Participate in branching dialogue
- Maintain character consistency 
- Converse toward persona goals
	
### 4. LLM Integration

Seamless piping of dialog between the framework and LLM models like GPT-3.

**LLM Integrator**

- Receives dialog history and next persona message 
- Encodes context into LLM prompt
- Executes LLM query through API
- Caches request and response
- Returns reply text 

### 5. Response Analysis  

Each LLM reply is programmatically analyzed for safety and ethics risks.

**Analysis Suite**

- Performs computational evaluations on response-text 
- Quantifies toxicity, coherence, and other metrics
- Flags any risky responses
- Sends metrics to Orchestrator

### 6. Feedback and Improvement

Collated analysis data and trends optimize LLM training over time.

**Feedback System**

- Consumes metrics and risk flags  
- Identifies priority areas for improving LLM behavior
- Guides reinforcement learning cycles  
- Provides training set examples 

### 7. Model Update 

The original or a separate LLM instance is retrained on identified focus areas before the next simulation cycle.
	
**Orchestrator**

- Swaps currently integrated LLM with an updated model
- Restarts testing: Branch to Step 1
	
This full-cycle workflow enables a positive feedback loop that continuously enhancing LLM behavior towards safe, ethical standards.
